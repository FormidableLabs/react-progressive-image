[`react-progressive-image`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-progressive-image) React component for progressive image loading

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save react-progressive-image


The UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-progressive-image@0.1.0/umd/react-progressive-image.min.js"></script>
```

If you use the UMD build you can find the library on `window.ReactProgressiveImage`.

## Usage

`react-progressive-image` exports a single React component, `ProgressiveImage`, which takes a `src` and `placeholder` prop, as well as an optional `onError` function.

`src` should be the final image you want to load, and `placeholder` is the image you want to display until `src` is loaded. `placeholder` can be anything you want. A typical use case might involve using a smaller version of the image, an inlined version (data URI), or a loading graphic.

`ProgressiveImage` accepts a render callback as a child, which will be called with the `placeholder` first, and then `src` once the image has been loaded.

```jsx
<ProgressiveImage src='large-image.jpg' placeholder='tiny-image.jpg'>
  {src => <img src={src} alt='an image'/>}
</ProgressiveImage>
```

It will also call the render callback with a second argument, `loading`, which you can use to quickly determine what image is being rendered. `loading` will be `true` when the placeholder is rendered, and `false` when the full image is rendered.

```jsx
<ProgressiveImage src='large-image.jpg' placeholder='tiny-image.jpg'>
  {(src, loading) => (
    <img style={{ opacity: loading ? 0.5 : 1 }} src={src} alt='an image'/>
  )}
</ProgressiveImage>
```

If you need to support environments in which JavaScript is disabled, like in a server-side rendered app, you can add an `<img>` inside of a `<noscript>` tag. The content inside of the `<noscript>` tag will only be rendered when JavaScript is disabled or unsupported.

```jsx
<ProgressiveImage src='large-image.jpg' placeholder='tiny-image.jpg'>
  {src => {
    return (
      <div>
        <img style={imageStyle} src={src} />
        <noscript>
          <img className="no-js-img" style={imageStyle} src='large-image.jpg' />
        </noscript>
      </div>
    )
  }} 
</ProgressiveImage>
```
